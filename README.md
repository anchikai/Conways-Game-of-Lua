# Conway's Game of Lua
If you aren't familiar with Conway's Game of Life, let me catch you up to speed.

## Here are the basic rules of the game:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Controls
- Esc - Pause the simulation
- G - Toggle the grid
- LMB - Place live cells while paused.
- RMB - Place dead cells while paused.
